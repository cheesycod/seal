# seal extras

Some extra libraries written in Luau, including Luau standard libraries extensions (like `tt`), as well as other helper libraries for general purpose programming concerns.

Feel free to modify these files, make your own, etc.! If you have any libraries you want to add, please submit a PR to `deviaze/seal`.
